Incremental learning is particularly useful in 
scenarios where data arrives continuously or is 
too large to fit into memory. This is
 a Python use case for incremental learning using 
 Scikit-Learn's SGDClassifier with the partial_fit 
 method. This approach is ideal for handling streaming 
 data or large datasets.


This code scenario where a financial institution wants
 to predict fraudulent transactions. New transaction 
 data arrives continuously, and the model needs to update 
 incrementally without retraining from scratch.


 Simulating Streaming Data:
The dataset is split into small batches to mimic real-time data streams.
Model Initialization:
SGDClassifier is used with partial_fit, which allows incremental updates.
The classes parameter ensures that the model knows all possible target labels.
Incremental Training:
The partial_fit method updates the model with each new batch of data.
Periodic evaluation helps monitor performance during training.
Final Evaluation:
After training on all batches, the model is evaluated on a separate test dataset.
